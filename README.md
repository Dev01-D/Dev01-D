### ❄️ Community & IceWhale
I’m a lead moderator for the **IceWhale** community. If you’re exploring the Zima ecosystem, you’ll find me on Discord helping users get the most out of their hardware.
- 🛡️ **Moderator**: Guiding the ZimaBoard/ZimaBlade/ZimaCube community.
- 🐧 **Self-Hosting**: Extensive experience with **ZimaOS**, **CasaOS**, **Debian**, **Ubuntu**, and Docker-based deployments.

### 🛡️ Cybersecurity & Defense
I treat my homelab as a digital playground. Combining a test environment and production environment to check stability and performance before delpoyment. 
My security interests focus on **Blue Team** defense and **Network Hardening**.
- 🔍 **Monitoring**: Setting up IDS/IPS (Suricata/Snort) and SIEM solutions to monitor lab traffic.
- 🔒 **Hardening**: Implementing zero-trust networking, SSH auditing, and secure containerization.
- ⚡ **Tooling**: Familiar with Nmap, Wireshark, and Kali Linux for local vulnerability scanning.

### 🏠 Lab & Workshop
- 🖥️ **Homelab**: A mix of Zima hardware and custom nodes for media, storage, and security testing.
- 🤖 **3D Printing**: Printing functional parts for server racks, custom hardware enclosures and general office organisation.
- 🔧 **Tinkering**: I love "voiding warranties" to build something useful, improve hardware performance or cooling.
